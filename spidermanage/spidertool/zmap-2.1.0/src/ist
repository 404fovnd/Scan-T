Nov 24 08:30:46.527 [WARN] blacklist: ZMap is currently using the default blacklist located at /etc/zmap/blacklist.conf. By default, this blacklist excludes locally scoped networks (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.1/8, and 192.168.0.0/16). If you are trying to scan local networks, you can change the default blacklist by editing the default ZMap configuration at /etc/zmap/zmap.conf.
